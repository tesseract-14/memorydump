- **Skull Item** - Does nothing...
- **Eye of Rah** - Teleports you randomly with effects (might suffocate you)
- **Buffer Item** - Grants strength with no catch (trust me)
- **Chaos Block** - Right-click for random potion effects.
- **Turner Block** - Transforms items dropped on it
- **Analyzer Item** - Scan yourself by right-clicking - entities by left clicking
